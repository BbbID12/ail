The Dedication Production Clusters is astonishing if you want a mature and extensive application and scalable solution in the cloud.
It provides a three-Virtual Machine redundant configuration provisioned by Platform.sh for each customer.  Every service is replicated across all three virtual machines in a failover configuration (as opposed to sharding), allowing a site to remain up even if one of the VMs is lost entirely.
Dedicated Production Clusters work nearly identically to Grid environments and it do not require extra configuration on the client-side.  However, the services PostgreSQL or Kafka are not available on this plan.
