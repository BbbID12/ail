As part of the onboarding service, you will continue to work with the Solutions Engineer who was present during the technical discovery and analysis during the pre-sales phase.  During the entire on-boarding process, your Solutions Engineer is available to assist with questions and prioritize any tickets that may be submitted through the help desk.
